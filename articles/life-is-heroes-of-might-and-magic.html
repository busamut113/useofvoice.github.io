<p>What was so awesome about Heroes of Might and Magic III that made us so excited and wanting to play it when we were kids?</p>

<p>Collecting those delicious, sparking jewels, crystals, gold and chests. Learning new magical spells. Having your own castle, upgrading buildings, recruiting and upgrading army units, collecting resoures and taking over the mines.</p>

<p>Battling monsters and other players for experience and rewards, taking over castles, magical spells, levelling up the hero, finding and collecting artifacts, variety of army units with unique abilities and spells, new territories to explore, treasure to discover, terreritory to conquer.</p>

<p>It was adventurous, magical, rich, the sound effects were beautiful, the music was a masterpiece played by actual orchestra, and graphics were out of this world beautiful for 1999.</p>

<p>Life is Heroes of Might and Magic. We're all in a super advanced game full of magical possibilities. You are a hero on a journey, think through your moves carefully, you only have so much time in a day.</p>

<p>Strategically position your army and spend your resources wisely. Upgrade your talents, skills level up and gain wisdom and experience by completing quests. Defeat monsters guarding treasure and resources mines.</p>

<p>Only then you will gain true wisdom that will allow you to learn higher level magical abilities and skills. Make sure your castle is well guarded, but at the same time don't just sit in your home all the time, go out on adventures and explore the world, that's how you become stronger, wiser and find all the gifts and artifacts waiting for you.</p>

<p>And don't forget about "holy grail", put the pieces of the puzzles together and realize what it actually is, keep digging until you find it, it's the ultimate prize!</p>
